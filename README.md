# Manaviya-prototype-code
During Covid, I was part of the manaviya project with a friend, during which I wrote the following code for the prototype app.
This project was meant to give people a service wherein they could check certain hospital resources based on the location they selected and the availability of said resources, along with the necessary information for said hospitals, plus a few other neat features.
Should be noted, the code technically would not run correctly simply due to the given json file that acts as the key having since expired, but the code itself works perfectly.
